Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the\nglobal smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart\ndevice fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of\nBellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The\ninsights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.\n\n\n## Business Task:\nAnalyze smart device usage data to derive insights for an existing Bellabeat product. Use insights to hypothesize solutions for making Bellabeat a larger player in the smart device market.\n\n**Key Questions:**\n* What trends can be found with the Fitbit usage data?\n* How can these trends transfer to Bellabeat customers?\n* How can these trends be exploited for product and marketing decisions?\n\n\n## Fitbit Dataset\n* **Where is your data stored?**\n    * These datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016 \n    * DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.53894 \n    \n\n* **How is the data organized? Is it in long or wide format?** \n   * Most data sets are organized in long format. With exceptions to the wide files including minute data for steps, calories and intentisties\n   \n\n* **Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data? Does your data ROCCC?** \n    * This data set meets the minimum sample size rule of 30. With 33 FitBit users to sample data from, the analysis is capable of deriving good insights into smart device usage\n    * Data is recent\n    * Data observes smart device usage of products that are highly similar to Bellabeat’s, making the data credible for the business task \n    * 3rd party data is open source and widely available \n    \n    \n* **How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?** \n    * Data is verified as a licensed public domain where the owner waives rights to the work\n    \n    \n* **How did you verify the data’s integrity?** \n    * Data is comprised of crowd-sourced Fitbit datasets\n    \n    \n* **How does it help you answer your question?** \n    * This data can be used to influence marketing decisions or functions for Bellabeat products\n    \n    \n* **Are there any problems with the data?**\n    * Data is small with only 33 participants. There is also no separation between race, gender, or other demographics. This may lead to trends or insights that aren’t as accurate for Women as Bellabeat is focused on women’s health products\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Cleaning \n\nThe

From the amount data received for different features. We can see that automatic features are more likely to be utilized. Marketing team should focus on pushing automatic features that are appealing to smart device customers. Management can also pursue solutions to less-used features. This could be by makinig the weight tracker more interactive. They could also notify users before bed that its time to sleep. These changes would go well with the Bellabeat app that advertizes keeping on top of mindful habits.   \n2. Most of the data pointed towards intensity and step count being major drivers of calorie count. The marketing team could add a program in the Bellabeat app that tells the user when to increase intensity during a workout to make sure a certain average intensity is reached. For those that prefer following a metric like steps, the app can use a milestone system that incentivizes users to reach a step count during their exercise. These changes will add more interaction between device and user. If the team can get their users to burn more calories, the users will realize better results which will bolster their reputation and make them a bigger player in the smart device market.\n3. My strongest recommendation would be to start collecting their own data from their customers. This data is good for smart-devices in general; however, for a niched company such as Bellabeat, first-party data would yield better insights when trying to cater to their personal audience. I would suggest gathering other types of data that relate to Bellabeat products like stress levels, menstural cycles, and water consumption.  \n\n## Limitations \n**Data is Third-party** - Although the data derives good insight for smart device users as a whole, the data represens Fitbit users of unknown demographic. This may lead to skewed insights or a company that focuses on Women's health products specifically.\n\n**Data is small** - This dataset represents a maximum of 33 people at once. This number can lead to useful insights; however, this means biased or false answers can greatly change the results of the analysis.
